# Phase 14: Sample Campaign & Demo Data - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Create pre-built demo campaign with phishing examples that users can load to explore features without manual setup. This is placeholder content that will be replaced by user's custom examples.

## Implementation Decisions

### Sample phish content
- Placeholder content only — user will overwrite with their specific examples later
- **Annotation density:** Light — 1-2 annotations per phish (not overwhelming, shows basics)
- **Annotation tone:** Casual and friendly (accessible, not overly technical)
- **Email length:** Brief — focused on the lure itself, minimal email context
- **Lure count:** Single lure per phish (keep it simple)
- **Phish variety:** Loosely related by topic (themed campaign scenario, not random collection)

### Campaign metadata
- **Campaign name:** Clearly labeled as sample/demo data (transparent this is example content)
- **Description length:** Brief — 1 sentence
- **Description tone:** Educational — explains what to look for and what features it demonstrates
- **Storage approach:** Pre-loaded in system (persists in localStorage after loading, not one-time generation)

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific phishing techniques to showcase (urgency, authority, etc.)
- Thematic connection between phishes
- Exact wording of campaign name and description
- Whether to include scheduled dates (optional for demo)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- "Just make it something to begin with" — placeholder nature is explicit
- User plans to customize content themselves, so implementation should be straightforward
- Keep demo content lightweight since it's temporary

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope.
