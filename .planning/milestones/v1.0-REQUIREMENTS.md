## Out of Scope

 Documented to prevent scope creep.

|Explicitly excluded. Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User accounts/authentication | LocalStorage-only, no cloud sync required |
| Real-time collaboration | Single-user tool |
| Email sending | Creation/annotation only, no delivery |
| Mobile app | Web-first, desktop-focused |
| Backend API | Purely client-side application |
| MITRE ATT&CK live API integration | Static JSON sufficient for v1 |
