### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- Phase 16: Campaigns-first workflow means campaigns list is default landing view (not standalone editor)
- Phase 16: LocalStorage migration from v2 to v3 required for key rename ("phishmonger-projects" → "phishmonger-phishes")
- Phase 16: Maintain backward compatibility for existing users (migration script runs on app mount)
